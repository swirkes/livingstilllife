# Sound Installation Project

This project features a series of interactive sound installations designed to engage participants through unique auditory and physical experiences. Each installation element combines artistic expression with technological innovation, inviting observers to explore and interact with the sounds produced by everyday objects.

The piece was presented at Taideyliopisto in Helsinki in December 2021. It is staged on a wooden table (118 cm x73.5 cm) with several audio exciters attached to the materials. A belaMini, mounted to the table, controls the sound. Because of the nature of the sound emission, the volume is highly localized, meaning that it is almost imperceptible if you are more than a few meters away.

## Installation Elements

### 1. Table

#### 1.1 Physical Description
- **Rectangular wooden table for four**
- Physical Measurements

#### 1.2 Sound Projection
- **Audio Exciter:** Attached to the underside of the table, connected to an amplifier.
- **Mono Audio Output:** Provided by Bela.

#### 1.3 Sound Material
- **Atmospheric Synth Sample:** Pre-recorded.
- **Playback Control:** A triangle wave generator determines the position of the pointer that iterates over the sample file.

#### 1.4 Interactive Element
- **Chairs and Invitation:** Chairs set up in front of the table invite guests to sit down. The words “SAA KOSKE” encourage interaction with the piece.

### 2. Copper Pot

#### 2.1 Physical Description
- **Decorative Copper Pot:** Small, with a chain for hanging.
- Physical Measurements

#### 2.2 Sound Projection
- **Audio Exciter:** Affixed to the inner bottom surface of the pot.
- **Ultrasonic Speaker Array:** Positioned at a specific angle from a set distance.

#### 2.3 Sound Material
- **Frequency Content:**
  - Highest amplitude resonant frequency: 1871 Hz.
  - Array of 20,000 highest amplitude frequencies from frequency sweep analysis.
- **2 Channel FM Synthesis:**
  - **Channel 1:** Carrier Frequency at 1871 Hz, modulated by an array of high amplitude frequencies, output to audio exciter.
  - **Channel 2:** Carrier Frequency of high amplitude frequencies, modulated by 1871 Hz, with a 2 ms delay, output to ultrasonic speaker.

#### 2.4 Interactive Element
- **Spoon Placement:** A spoon inside the pot invites observers to tap and scrape the pot.

### 3. Book

#### 3.1 Physical Description
- **Hardcover Book:** Approximately *** pages.
- **Fanned Pages:** Pages are fanned over towards the center.
- Physical Measurements

#### 3.2 Sound Projection
- **Audio “Coin” Exciter:** Located inside the spine, with the adhesive part attached to the pages.

#### 3.3 Sound Material
- **Sample:** Recording of fingers paging through a book.
- **Playback Control:** A noise generator determines the position of the pointer that iterates over the sample file.

#### 3.4 Interactive Element
- **Sticky Notes:** Four small sticky notes placed throughout the pages invite observers to page through the book.

### 4. Glass Vase

#### 4.1 Physical Description
- **Humppila Glass Vase:** Features a non-geometric shape.
- Physical Measurements

#### 4.2 Sound Projection
- **Audio Exciter:** Affixed to the bottom outside surface of the vase.

#### 4.3 Sound Material
- **Sample:** Recording of the vase being bowed with a violin bow.
- **Playback Control:** A sine wave generator determines the position of the pointer that iterates over the sample file.

#### 4.4 Interactive Element
- **Violin Bow and Rosin:** Placed on the table next to the vase.
- **Instructional Graphic:** A small graphic demonstrating how to rosin the bow and bow the glass.

## How to Interact with the Installations

Each installation invites participants to explore the soundscapes created through physical interaction:
- **Table:** Sit down and touch the table as indicated by the “SAA KOSKE” sign.
- **Copper Pot:** Use the spoon to tap and scrape the inside of the pot.
- **Book:** Page through the book using the sticky notes as guides.
- **Glass Vase:** Use the violin bow and rosin provided to bow the vase as demonstrated in the instructional graphic.

These installations combine tactile and auditory elements to create immersive sound experiences. Enjoy your interaction with each unique sound piece!
